* **Switch Basic & Advanced**: Click the **"▲ Triangle Button"** on the top left of the keyboard to open the advanced panel (includes trigonometry, logarithms, pi, etc.).

## 📜 2. Gesture-based History
Forgot what you were just calculating? Besides the "⌛" button on the top left, you can also...

* **Swipe Down Anywhere**: Quickly **swipe down** on **any part** of the screen to open the history list.
* **Swipe Up to Close**: When you are done, swipe up to close the list.
* **Manage History**: Click the **"Trash Can Icon"** on the top right to clear all history. Click on a single record to paste the formula and answer into the current display.

## 🎨 3. Create Your Own Style

* **Customize Details**: You can adjust the background opacity to create a unique visual experience.


## ⚙️ 4. Personal Settings
Everyone uses their phone differently, so there are plenty of options to adjust.

* **Language**: Fully supports switching between **Traditional Chinese** and **English**.
* **Font Size**: Use the slider to adjust the text size for your eyes.
* **Haptic Feedback**: Toggle **"Vibration"** and **"Sound Effects"** on or off to enjoy every click. Note: Your phone's system settings must be enabled for this to work.
